# open-architectures

Welcome to **open-architectures**!  
This repo is all about making AI models genuinely open—by sharing not just the weights, but the full blueprints behind them. If you’ve ever been frustrated by “open” models that only give you half the story, you’re in the right place.

## What’s Inside?

- **Complete Model Architectures:** Full Pytorch Architectures for popular open-weight models.
- **Transparency First:** Understand *how* models are built, not just what they do.
- **For Everyone:** Whether you’re a researcher, developer, or just curious, you’re welcome here.

##  Why Does This Matter?

Most “open” models only release weights, leaving the actual design in the dark. We believe real openness means sharing *everything*—so the whole community can learn, build, and innovate together.
